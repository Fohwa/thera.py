# thera.py

I was asking myself the question: "What is the best language for a therapy program?"
The obvious answer is of course python, so you can call it "thera.py"

So now this project is created

## Function

At the moment the program does not much:
It insults you randomly after asking a question.
This is already funnier than I imagined.
You can stop it by using 'stop'
But in the future I want to add some features:

## In progress

Planned is some kind of text analysing.
This is already added as a ptototyp:
It will work with the words 'help', 'hello', 'hi' and 'hey'

This will generate insults based on the context of the question
Second would be a better user interface, like a gui.

## Guide

You will need Python: https://www.python.org/
Also you need the pyttsx3 extension: command line "pip install pyttsx3"
